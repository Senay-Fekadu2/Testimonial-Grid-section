        <h1>I recieve a job offer mid-course, and the subjects learned were current, if not more so, in the company 
            I joined. I honesltly feel I got every penny's worth

        <P ><q>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and 
          have read heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro mid-course
          and found it incredably fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. the next 12 weeks was the best and most
          grueling - time of my life, since completing the course, I've succesfully switched careers. working as 
          a software engineer at VR startup.

        <h1>Such a life-changing experience.Highly recommended!</h1>
        <P >
          <q>Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code I needed some structure from professionals
             who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs 
             who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire  curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
             The were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular
             was outstanding. it took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. in fact
             , I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped
             me land a job as full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!
